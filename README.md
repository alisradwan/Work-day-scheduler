## Description

I created this Work day scheduler to display my JavaScript, HTML, CSS Skills. when the user clicks the space infront the time that he will like to remember later this web will save his notices.

## What I learned

I learned many important fundementals of javascript creating this project. I used a combination of objects, arrays, function calls, while statements and if statements. I learned how to call functions, return values and many different manipulations that can be performed on objects, arrays and numbers like Math.Floor, Math.random and isFinite. I also learned commonly used operators like ! and ===. I really enjoyed my time learning and creating this project!
